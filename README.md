After attending classes on design, HTML, and CSS, we were tasked with coding our very first website. Part of the brief involved choosing one of three different brands and creating its profile, along with coding the entire site. 
[The website](https://nicolaibye.github.io/html-css-course-squareeyes/)

## Description

The project brief, broken down:

- Build a functioning and responsive website based on your Design 1 class.
- Ensure that the site architecture matches the given design; if JavaScript is required, pages should mimic the intended functionality.
- The HTML should be semantic, neatly formatted, and valid.
- The CSS should adhere to the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- Frameworks are not permitted.
- The site must comply with WCAG standards, with accessibility considered throughout.
- Each page must have a unique meta name="description", title, and h1 tag.
- You must not use copied code. All submitted code must be your work.

The goal of this project was to help us become comfortable with the new languages we were learning—HTML and CSS—and to practise translating a Figma design into code.
